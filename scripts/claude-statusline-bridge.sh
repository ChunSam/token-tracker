# Token Tracker status-line bridge (macOS / Linux).
#
# Claude Code's status line is handed, on stdin, the 5-hour and 7-day usage
# percentages for the account. Token Tracker cannot ask for those itself once the
# access token Claude Code stored has lapsed, because only the CLI refreshes it.
# This script records just those numbers to a local file that Token Tracker
# reads, and then runs whatever status-line command you already had, with the
# same stdin, so your status line keeps printing exactly what it printed before.
#
# Install by pointing `statusLine.command` in ~/.claude/settings.json at this
# script, with your existing command after `--`:
#
#   "statusLine": {
#     "type": "command",
#     "command": "/path/to/claude-statusline-bridge.sh -- node /your/statusline.js"
#   }
#
# With no command after `--` the bridge prints nothing, which is a status line
# that shows only Claude Code's own footer badges.
#
# What is written (and nothing else): the two usage percentages, the instant each
# window resets, and two timestamps. No token, no session id, no transcript path,
# no prompt text — the rest of the payload is read and dropped. The file is the
# caller's own, mode 0600.
#
# Override the destination with TOKEN_TRACKER_STATUSLINE_FILE (used by the tests).
# Set TOKEN_TRACKER_STATUSLINE_DEBUG=1 to have recording failures explain
# themselves on stderr instead of staying silent. The status line reads stdout,
# so this never changes what it shows.
#
# Requires python3 (or python) for JSON parsing. Without one the bridge records
# nothing and still runs your command, so the status line never breaks.

set -u

# Everything after the first `--` is the command to run; without a `--`, every
# argument is. Supporting both means a pasted command works either way.
